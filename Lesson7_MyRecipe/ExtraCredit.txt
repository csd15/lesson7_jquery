I chose CornBread to do my recipe for Lesson 7. For my DOM traversal I stuck with the next() method because I just like that one better. For the CSS change, I changed the backgroud color to brown behind the ingredients and the instructions header. Lastly, for the animation/event, I chose the fadeTo method with a duration of 5000 miliseconds and .2 as the opacity. I like how you have to stay hovered on which ever section you prefer to keep it on the page.
